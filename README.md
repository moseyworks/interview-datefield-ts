# About

This is the initial template for running the datefield interview question. The project uses boilerplate webpack and typescript setup for convenience.


## Running the dev server

```
npm install && npm start
```

The dev server will be running on `localhost:9000` and any code changes to source files will automatically reload the browser on save.


## Running tests

```
npm test
```

## Using vanilla JavaScript instead TypeScript

You can use js instead of ts by renaming `index.ts` to `index.js`, changing `entry` in `webpack.dev.js` to `./src/index.js`, and restarting the dev server.
